          attended Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, and graduated in 2008.</p>

        <p>Daniel fell in love with politics and community work at an early age. He began his political career in 2007
          as a field organizer for then-candidate Barack Obama's Presidential campaign. He was recognized for his
          compassion, relatability and results-oriented approach. He was recruited to work on other campaigns, and has
          a long track record of success. Examples include current North Carolina Congresswoman Alma Adams, current
          Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden, current Mecklenburg County District Attorney Spencer
          Merriweather, current Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, current Mecklenburg County Commissioner Vilma Leake, current
          District Court Judge Aretha Blake, current Charlotte City Council Member Dimple Ajmera, among many others.

        <p>Daniel is the current Youth Director of S.A.V.E. (Safeguard Atone Validate Educate), where they make
          troubled youth "job ready instead of jail ready." He is very active in the community and has partnered with
          several non-profits including the Urban League of Central Carolinas, Habitat for Humanity, the Salvation
          Army, and many others. He has worked professionally in Human Resources, Finance, Insurance, Accounting,
          Manufacturing, Customer Service and Sales, and is currently a student at UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp.
